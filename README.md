# Library Books

The **Library Books** project is a front-end practice website showcasing a cart and inquiry page for an online library. It focuses on design and layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was developed as part of an **assessment activity** for my course at **Southern Cross University (SCU) Gold Coast**, as part of the **Bachelor of Information Technology** program.
